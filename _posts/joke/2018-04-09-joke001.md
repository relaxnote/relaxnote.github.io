A male driver is pulled over by a cop and the following conversation takes place: Man: What's the problem officer? 

Cop: You were going at least 75 in a 55 zone.

Man: No sir, I was going 65. 

Wife: Oh Harry. You were going 80.

(Man gives his wife a dirty look.) 

Man: Broken tail light? I didn't know about a broken tail light!

Wife: Oh Harry, you've known about that tail light for weeks.

(Man gives his wife a dirty look.)

Cop: Iam also going to give you a citation for not wearing your seat belt.

Man: Oh, I just took it off when you were walking up to the car. 

Wife: Oh Harry, you never wear your seat belt. 

Man: Shut your mouth, woman!

Wife: No, only when he's drunk.
